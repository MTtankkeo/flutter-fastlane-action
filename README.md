# Introduction
This Flutter package provides a one-step CI/CD solution for Flutter apps. For a project without any Fastlane setup, it automatically configures all necessary **Fastlane settings**, builds your **Android** and **iOS** apps, and deploys them to **Google Play** and the **App Store** with zero manual setup. Developers only need to provide **six essential configuration values** in GitHub Secrets.

> [!TIP]
> If you are new to Fastlane or CI/CD, use [GitHub Wiki - Basic-Settings](https://github.com/MTtankkeo/flutter-fastlane-action/wiki/Basic-Settings) to learn the basic concepts and usage, and follow along to apply them to your project.
